# TicketMaster

_an eth prague 2023 submission_

The `ticketmaster` is a coordinator that allows users to purchase "tickets"
that can later be "redeemed" to fund a [stealth account][1]. The mechanism uses
blind signatures so the coordinator is unable to link individual tickets with
redeemers. It is an implementation of Toni Wahrst√§tter's post ["Fee
Ticketing"][2].
